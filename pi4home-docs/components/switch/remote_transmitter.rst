.. _remote-transmitter-component:

Component/Hub
-------------

The ``remote_transmitter`` component lets you send infrared messages to control
devices in your home. First, you need to setup a global hub that specifies which pin your remote
sender is connected to. Afterwards you can create :ref:`individual
switches <remote-transmitter-switch>` that each send a pre-defined remote signal to a device.

Use-cases are for example infrared remotes or 433MHz signals.

.. note::

    This component is *much* more accurate on the ESP32, since that chipset has a dedicated
    peripheral for sending exact signal sequences.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIO32
      carrier_duty_percent: 50%

    # Individual switches
    switch:
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        name: "Panasonic TV Off"
        panasonic:
          address: 0x4004
          command: 0x100BCBD

Configuration variables:
************************

-  **pin** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The pin to transmit the remote signal on.
-  **carrier_duty_percent** (*Optional*, int): How much of the time the remote is on. For example, infrared
   protocols modulate the signal using a carrier signal. Set this is ``50%`` if you're working with IR leds and to
   ``100%`` if working with a other things like 433MHz transmitters.
-  **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify
   the ID used for code generation. Use this if you have multiple remote transmitters.

.. note::

    See :ref:`finding_remote_codes` for a guide for setting this up.

.. _remote-transmitter-switch:

Switch
------

The ``remote_transmitter`` switch platform allows you to create switches
that send a pre-defined remote control sequence
using the :ref:`remote-transmitter-component`. Every time
the switch is turned on, the configured remote signal is sent.

Use cases include, but are not limited to, infrared remotes, 433MHz signals and so on.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    remote_transmitter:
      pin: 32

    # Individual switches
    switch:
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        name: "Panasonic TV Off"
        panasonic:
          address: 0x4004
          command: 0x100BCBD
        repeat: 25

Configuration variables:
************************

- **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the switch.
- The remote code, see :ref:`remote_transmitter-codes`. Only one
  of them can be specified per switch.
- **repeat** (*Optional*, int): How often the command should be sent.

  - **times** (int): The number of times the code should be sent. Defaults to ``1``.
  - **wait_time** (:ref:`time <config-time>`): The time to wait between repeats.

- **remote_transmitter_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): The id of the :ref:`remote-transmitter-component`.
  Defaults to the first hub specified.
- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- All other options from :ref:`Switch <config-switch>`.

.. note::

    For the Sonoff RF Bridge you can use `this hack <https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/Hardware-Itead-Sonoff-RF-Bridge---Direct-Hack>`__
    created by the Github user wildwiz. Then use this configuration for the remote receiver/transmitter hubs:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        remote_receiver:
          pin: 4
          dump: all

        remote_transmitter:
          pin: 5
          carrier_duty_percent: 100%

    Supporting the RF Bridge chip directly is currently only a long-term goal for PI4Home.

.. _finding_remote_codes:

Finding Remote Codes
--------------------

Each remote transmitter uses a different protocol to send its information. So to replicate an infrared or 433MHz
remote you will first need to "learn" these codes. You will first need to hook up a receiver and sniff the codes
using the :doc:`remote receiver component </components/binary_sensor/remote_receiver>` like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_receiver:
      pin: GPIO34
      # dump all signals we find
      dump: all

And then activate the remote control you want to have in PI4Home. you will see a log output like this:

.. figure:: images/rf_receiver-log_raw.png
    :align: center

    Example log output for a 433MHz proprietary remote control.

Raw Remote Codes
****************

If PI4Home has a decoder set up for the code, it will spit out the decoded code in the logs. In this case,
it's a proprietary protocol which would be difficult to reverse engineer. Fortunately, we can just
do a "replay attack" by repeating the signal we just saw for our own purposes. The output you see in above image
is encoded in microseconds: A negative value represents the output being LOW for x microseconds and a positive
value denotes the output being HIGH for the specified number of microseconds.

Now you only need to set up the remote transmitter (which well *send* the code) like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    remote_transmitter:
      pin: GPIO23
      # Set to 100% when working with RF signals, and 50% if working with IR leds
      carrier_duty_percent: 100%

And lastly, we need to set up the switch that, when turned on, will send our pre-defined remote code:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        name: "My awesome RF switch"
        raw: [4088, -1542, 1019, -510, 513, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 1020,
              -1020, 1022, -1019, 510, -509, 511, -510, 511, -509, 511, -510,
              1020, -1019, 510, -511, 1020, -510, 512, -508, 510, -1020, 1022,
              -1021, 1019, -1019, 511, -510, 510, -510, 1022, -1020, 1019,
              -1020, 511, -511, 1018, -1022, 1020, -1019, 1021, -1019, 1020,
              -511, 510, -1019, 1023, -1019, 1019, -510, 512, -508, 510, -511,
              512, -1019, 510, -509]

Note that you don't need to include the leading ``32519`` here, as it denotes a final space at the end of
a transmission.

RCSwitch Remote Codes
*********************

Starting with version 1.8.0 PI4Home can also recognize a bunch of 433MHz RF codes directly using `RCSwitch's <https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch>`__
remote protocol. If you have RF code dumping enabled for the receiver, you will then see log outputs like this one:

.. code::

    Received RCSwitch: protocol=1 data='0100010101'

Like before with raw codes, you can then use this code to create switches:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        name: "Living Room Lights On"
        rc_switch_raw:
          code: '0100010101'
          protocol: 1

Alternatively, you can use the information on `this page <https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/wiki/HowTo_OperateLowCostOutlets>`__
to manually find the RCSwitch codes without having to first find them using the remote receiver. For example, this would
be the PI4Home equivalent of the first Type-A switch on that site:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        name: "Living Room Lights On"
        rc_switch_type_a:
          group: '1101'
          device: '0100'
          state: True

.. _remote_transmitter-on_off_template:

On/Off template
---------------

Each switch of the ``remote_transmitter`` platform only sends a pre-defined remote code when switched on.
For example the RCSwitch example above always **sends the turn on** RF code to the wall plug. In some cases
you might want to have switches that can do both things, i.e. turn a light on when switched on and turn a light off
when switched off. To do this, use the :doc:`/components/switch/template` like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        id: living_room_lights_on
        rc_switch_type_a:
          group: '1101'
          device: '0100'
          state: True
      - platform: remote_transmitter
        id: living_room_lights_off
        rc_switch_type_a:
          group: '1101'
          device: '0100'
          state: False
      - platform: template
        name: Living Room Lights
        optimistic: True
        assumed_state: True
        turn_on_action:
          - switch.turn_on: living_room_lights_on
        turn_off_action:
          - switch.turn_on: living_room_lights_off


.. _rc_switch-protocol:

RCSwitch Protocol
-----------------

RCSwitch transmitters/receivers all have a ``protocol:`` option that can be used to tell PI4Home what timings to use
for the transmission. This is necessary as many remotes use different timings to encode a logic zero or one.

RCSwitch has 7 built-in protocols that cover most use cases. You can however also choose to use custom parameters
for the protocol like so

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Use one of RCSwitch's pre-defined protocols (1-7)
    protocol: 1

    # Use a custom protocol:
    protocol:
      pulse_length: 175
      sync: [1, 31]
      zero: [1, 3]
      one: [3, 1]
      inverted: False

Configuration options for the custom variant:

- **pulse_length** (**Required**, int): The length of each pulse in microseconds.
- **sync** (*Optional*): The number of on and off pulses for a sync bit. Defaults to 1 pulse on and 31 pulses off.
- **zero** (*Optional*): The number of on and off pulses to encode a logic zero. Defaults to 1 pulse on and 3 pulses off.
- **one** (*Optional*): The number of on and off pulses to encode a logic one. Defaults to 3 pulses on and 1 pulse off.
- **inverted** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to treat this protocol as inverted, i.e. encode all on pulses by logic LOWs
  and vice versa.
