    :description: Getting Started guide for installing PI4Home as a Hass.io Add-on and creating a basic configuration.

PI4Home is the perfect solution for creating custom firmwares for
your ESP8266/ESP32 boards. In this guide weâ€™ll go through how to setup a
basic "node" by use of the Hass.io add-on.

But first, here's a very quick introduction of how PI4Home works:
PI4Home is a *tool* which reads in YAML configuration files (just like Home Assistant)
and creates custom firmwares. The tool also has many helpers that simplify flashing devices
and aims to make managing your ESP boards as simple as possible. Once you have added devices
or sensors in PI4Home's configuration, they will even automatically show up in Home
Assistant's UI.

Installation
------------

Installing the PI4Home Hass.io add-on is easy. Just navigate to the Hass.io
panel in your Home Assistant frontend and add the PI4Home add-on repository:
https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/hassio

.. figure:: images/hassio_repo.png

After that, wait a bit until the add-on is installed (this can take a while) and
go to the add-on page. Start the add-on and then click "Open Web UI".

You should now be greeted by a nice introduction wizard which will step you through
creating your first configuration.

Dashboard Interface
-------------------

Assuming you created your first configuration file with the wizard, let's take a quick
tour of the PI4Home dashboard interface.

.. figure:: images/hassio_interface.png
    :align: center
    :width: 95.0%

On the front page you will see all configurations for nodes you created. For each file,
there are three basic actions you can perform:

- **UPLOAD**: This compiles the firmware for your node and uploads it using any connected
  USB device or, if no USB devices are connected, over-the-air using the :doc:`/components/ota`.

  .. warning::

      The Hass.io Add-On is currently not capable of discovering new USB ports after the add-on
      has started due to some docker restrictions. Please go to the add-on details page
      and restart the add-on if a new USB device is not automatically found. If the USB device
      is still not found, try changing the USB cable and restarting the add-on.

- **SHOW LOGS**: With this command you can view all the logs the node is outputting. If a USB device is
  connected, it will attempt to use the serial connection. Otherwise it will use the built-in OTA logs.

- **COMPILE**: This command compiles the firmware and gives you the option of downloading the generated
  binary so that you can upload it yourself from your computer.

  .. note::

      If you're having problems with flashing over USB, you can always download the firmware using the
      ``COMPILE`` button and flash the firmware using :ref:`PI4Home-flasher <pi4home-flasher>`.

The configuration files for PI4Home can be found and edited under ``<HOME_ASSISTANT_CONFIG>/pi4home/``.
For example the configuration for the node in the picture above can be found
in ``/config/pi4home/livingroom.yaml``.

Now go ahead and use one of the :ref:`devices guides <devices>` to extend your configuration for the device you
intend to flash an PI4Home firmware onto. Then proceed with uploading the first firmware using the
upload button.

Adding some (basic) features
----------------------------

So now you should have a file called ``/config/pi4home/livingroom.yaml`` (or similar).
Go open that file in and add a :doc:`simple GPIO switch </components/switch/gpio>`
to the configuration like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    switch:
      - platform: gpio
        name: "Living Room Dehumidifier"
        pin: 5

In above example, we're simply adding a switch that's called "Living Room Dehumidifier" (could control
anything really, for example lights) and is connected to the pin ``GPIO5``.

Now when you go to the Home Assistant "Integrations" screen (under "Configuration" panel), you
should see the PI4Home device show up in the discovered section (can take up to 5 minutes).
Alternatively, you can manually add the device by clicking "CONFIGURE" on the PI4Home integration
and entering "<NODE_NAME>.local" as the host.

.. figure:: /components/switch/images/gpio-ui.png
    :align: center
    :width: 75.0%

After the first upload, you will probably never need to use the USB
cable again, as all features of PI4Home are enabled remotely as well.
No more opening hidden boxes stowed in places hard to reach. Yay!

Adding A Binary Sensor
----------------------

Next, weâ€™re going to add a very simple binary sensor that periodically
checks a GPIO pin whether itâ€™s pulled high or low - the :doc:`GPIO Binary
Sensor </components/binary_sensor/gpio>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    binary_sensor:
      - platform: gpio
        name: "Living Room Window"
        pin:
          number: 16
          inverted: True
          mode: INPUT_PULLUP

This is an advanced feature of PI4Home, almost all pins can
optionally have a more complicated configuration schema with options for
inversion and pinMode - the :ref:`Pin Schema <config-pin_schema>`.

This time when uploading, you donâ€™t need to have the device plugged in
through USB again. The upload will magically happen :doc:`"over the air" </components/ota>`.

Where To Go Next
----------------

Great ðŸŽ‰! Youâ€™ve now successfully setup your first PI4Home project
and uploaded your first PI4Home custom firmware to your node. Youâ€™ve
also learned how to enable some basic components via the configuration
file.

So now is a great time to go take a look at the :doc:`Components Index </index>`.
Hopefully youâ€™ll find all sensors/outputs/â€¦ youâ€™ll need in there. If youâ€™re having any problems or
want new features, please either create a new issue on the `GitHub issue
tracker <https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/issues/issues>`__ or find us on the
`Discord chat <https://discord.gg/KhAMKrd>`__ (also make sure to read the :doc:`FAQ <faq>`).
