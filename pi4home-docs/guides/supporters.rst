**Hi! I'm Khzd, the author and main developer of PI4Home, adapted from esphome ( Otto Winter).**

Developing PI4Home takes a lot of time. There's a lot of things that go
into developing and maintaining an open-source project: from developing new features, fixing bugs,
answering questions to maintaining servers, preparing releases and moderating discussions.
And of course all of the hardware for new features has to be bought too. Otto Winter is a student
so he really appreciate donations :)

**You can support PI4Home's development** by becoming a Patron or a one-time contribution
with PayPal.
