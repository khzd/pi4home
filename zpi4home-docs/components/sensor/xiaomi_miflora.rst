The ``xiaomi_miflora`` sensor platform lets you track the output of Xiaomi MiFlora Bluetooth Low Energy
devices using the :doc:`/components/esp32_ble_tracker`. This component will track the
temperature, humidity and optionally the battery level of the MiFlora device every time the sensor
sends out a BLE broadcast. Note that contrary to other implementations, PI4Home can track as many
MiFlora devices at once as you want.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    esp32_ble_tracker:

    sensor:
      - platform: xiaomi_miflora
        mac_address: 94:2B:FF:5C:91:61
        temperature:
          name: "Xiaomi MiFlora Temperature"
        moisture:
          name: "Xiaomi MiFlora Moisture"
        illuminance:
          name: "Xiaomi MiFlora Illuminance"
        conductivity:
          name: "Xiaomi MiFlora Soil Conductivity"
        battery_level:
          name: "Xiaomi MiFlora Battery Level"

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **mac_address** (**Required**, MAC Address): The MAC address of the Xiaomi MiFlora device.
- **temperature** (*Optional*): The information for the temperature sensor.

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the temperature sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **moisture** (*Optional*): The information for the moisture sensor

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the moisture sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **illuminance** (*Optional*): The information for the illuminance sensor

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the illuminance sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **conductivity** (*Optional*): The information for the soil conductivity sensor

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the soil conductivity sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.

- **battery_level** (*Optional*): The information for the battery level sensor

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the humidity sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.


Setting Up Devices
------------------

Before you can even scan for the MiFlora sensor, you need to activate it using the Flower Care app. Set it up there and you'll be able to discover it.

To set up Xiaomi MiFlora devices you first need to find their MAC Address so that PI4Home can
identify them. So first, create a simple configuration without any ``xiaomi_miflora`` entries like so:

.. code-block:: yaml

    esp32_ble_tracker:

After uploading the ESP32 will immediately try to scan for BLE devices such as the Xiaomi MiFlora. When
it detects these sensors, it will automatically parse the BLE message print a message like this one:

.. code::

    Xiaomi MiFlora 94:2B:FF:5C:91:61 Got temperature=23.4Â°C

Note that it can sometimes take some time for the first BLE broadcast to be received.

Then just copy the address (``94:2B:FF:5C:91:61``) into a new ``sensor.xiaomi_miflora`` platform entry like
in the configuration example at the top.
