    :keywords: WiFi, WLAN, ESP8266, ESP32

This core PI4Home component sets up WiFi connections to access points
for you. It needs to be in your configuration or otherwise PI4Home
will fail in the config validation stage.

Itâ€™s recommended to provide a static IP for your node, as it can
dramatically improve connection times.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    wifi:
      ssid: MyHomeNetwork
      password: VerySafePassword

      # Optional manual IP
      manual_ip:
        static_ip: 10.0.0.42
        gateway: 10.0.0.1
        subnet: 255.255.255.0

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **ssid** (*Optional*, string): The name (or `service set
  identifier <https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-service-set-identifier-816547>`__)
  of the WiFi access point your device should connect to.
- **password** (*Optional*, string): The password (or PSK) for your
  WiFi network. Leave empty for no password.
- **networks** (*Optional*): Configure multiple WiFi networks to connect to, the best one
  that is reachable will be connected to. See :ref:`wifi-networks`.
- **manual_ip** (*Optional*): Manually configure the static IP of the node.

  - **static_ip** (*Required*, IPv4 address): The static IP of your node.
  - **gateway** (*Required*, IPv4 address): The gateway of the local network.
  - **subnet** (*Required*, IPv4 address): The subnet of the local network.
  - **dns1** (*Optional*, IPv4 address): The main DNS server to use.
  - **dns2** (*Optional*, IPv4 address): The backup DNS server to use.

- **use_address** (*Optional*, string): Manually override what address to use to connect
  to the ESP. Defaults to auto-generated value. Example, if you have changed your static IP and want to flash OTA to the prior configured IP address.
- **ap** (*Optional*): Enable an access point mode on the node.

  - **ssid** (*Required*, string): The name of the access point to create.
  - **password** (*Optional* string): The password for the access point. Leave empty for
    no password.
  - **channel** (*Optional*, int): The channel the AP should operate on from 1 to 14.
    Defaults to 1.
  - **manual_ip** (*Optional*): Manually set the IP options for the AP. Same options as
    manual_ip for station mode.

- **domain** (*Optional*, string): Set the domain of the node hostname used for uploading.
  For example, if it's set to ``.local``, all uploads will be sent to ``<HOSTNAME>.local``.
  Defaults to ``.local``.
- **reboot_timeout** (*Optional*, :ref:`time <config-time>`): The amount of time to wait before rebooting when no
  WiFi connection exists. Can be disabled by setting this to ``0s``, but note that the low level IP stack currently
  seems to have issues with WiFi where a full reboot is required to get the interface back working. Defaults to ``5min``.
- **power_save_mode** (*Optional*, string): The power save mode for the WiFi interface. Defaults to no power saving.
  See :ref:`wifi-power_save_mode`

- **fast_connect** (*Optional*, boolean): If enabled, directly connects to WiFi network without doing a full scan
  first. This is required for hidden networks and can significantly improve connection times. Defaults to ``off``.
  The downside is that this option connects to the first network the ESP sees, even if that network is very far away and
  better ones are available.

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.

Access Point Mode
-----------------

PI4Home has an optional "Access Point Mode". If you include ``ap:``
in your wifi configuration, PI4Home will automatically set up an access point that you
can connect to. Additionally, you can specify both a "normal" station mode and AP mode at the
same time. This will cause PI4Home to only enable the access point when no connection
to the wifi router can be made.

.. _wifi-manual_ip:

Manual IPs
----------

If you're having problems with your node not connecting to WiFi or the connection
process taking a long time, it can be a good idea to assign a static IP address
to the ESP. This way, the ESP doesn't need to go through the slow DHCP process.

You can do so with the ``manual_ip:`` option in the WiFi configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    wifi:
      # ...
      manual_ip:
        # Set this to the IP of the ESP
        static_ip: 10.0.0.42
        # Set this to the IP address of the router. Often ends with .1
        gateway: 10.0.0.1
        # The subnet of the network. 255.255.255.0 works for most home networks.
        subnet: 255.255.255.0

After putting a manual IP in your configuration, the ESP will no longer need to negotiate
a dynamic IP address with the router, thus improving the time until connection.

Additionally, this can help with :doc:`Over-The-Air updates <ota>` if for example the
home network doesn't allow for ``.local`` addresses. When a manual IP is in your configuration,
the OTA process will automatically choose that as the target for the upload.

.. _wifi-power_save_mode:

Power Save Mode
---------------

The WiFi interface of all ESPs offer three power save modes to reduce the amount of power spent on
WiFi. While some options *can* reduce the power usage of the ESP, they generally also decrease the
reliability of the WiFi connection, with frequent disconnections from the router in the highest
power saving mode.

The default is ``none`` (a bit of power saving). If you experience frequent WiFi disconnection problems,
please also try ``light``.

- ``NONE`` (least power saving, Default)
- ``LIGHT``
- ``HIGH`` (most power saving)

.. code-block:: yaml

    wifi:
      # ...
      power_save_mode: none

.. _wifi-networks:

Connecting to Multiple Networks
-------------------------------

Starting with version 1.10.0, you can give PI4Home a number of WiFi networks to connect to.
PI4Home will then attempt to connect to the one with the highest signal strength.

To enable this mode, remove the ``ssid`` and ``password`` options from your wifi configuration
and move everything under the ``networks`` key:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    wifi:
      networks:
      - ssid: FirstNetworkToConnectTo
        password: VerySafePassword
      - ssid: SecondNetworkToConnectTo
        password: VerySafePassword
      # Other options
      # ...

Configuration variables:

- **ssid** (*Optional*, string): The SSID or WiFi network name.
- **password** (*Optional*, string): The password to use for authentication. Leave empty for no password.
- **channel** (*Optional*, int): The channel of the network (1-14). If given, only connects to networks
  that are on this channel.
- **bssid** (*Optional*, string): Optionally define a BSSID (MAC-Address) of the network to connect to.
  This can be used to further restrict which networks to connect to.
- **hidden** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether this network is hidden. Defaults to false.
  If you add this option you also have to specify ssid.
