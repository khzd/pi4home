    :description: Instructions for setting up the core PI4Home configuration.
    :image: cloud-circle.png

Here you specify some core information that PI4Home needs to create
firmwares. Most importantly, this is the section of the configuration
where you specify the **name** of the node, the **platform** and
**board** youâ€™re using.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    pi4home:
        name: livingroom
        platform: ESP32
        board: nodemcu-32s

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **name** (**Required**, string): This is the name of the node. It
  should always be unique to the node and no other node in your system
  can use the same name. It can also only contain upper/lowercase
  characters, digits and underscores.
- **platform** (**Required**, string): The platform your board is on,
  either ``ESP32`` or ``ESP8266``. See :ref:`pi4home-arduino_version`.
- **board** (**Required**, string): The board PI4Home should
  specify for platformio. For the ESP32, choose the appropriate one
  from `this list <http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#boards>`__
  and use `this list <http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif8266.html#boards>`__
  for ESP8266-based boards.

Advanced options:

- **pi4home_core_version** (*Optional*): The version of the C++ `PI4Home-Core framework <https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home-core>`__
  to use. See :ref:`pi4home-pi4home_core_version`.
- **arduino_version** (*Optional*): The version of the arduino framework to link the project against.
  See :ref:`pi4home-arduino_version`.
- **build_path** (*Optional*, string): Customize where PI4Home will store the build files
  for your node. By default, PI4Home puts all platformio project files under a folder ``<NODE_NAME>/``,
  but you can customize this behavior using this option.
- **platformio_options** (*Optional*, mapping): Additional options to pass over to platformio in the
  platformio.ini file. See :ref:`pi4home-platformio_options`.
- **use_custom_code** (*Optional*, boolean): Whether to configure the project for writing custom components.
  This sets up some flags so that custom code should compile correctly
- **includes** (*Optional*, list of files): A list of files to include in the main (auto-generated) sketch file
  for custom components. The paths in this list are relative to the directory where the YAML configuration file
  is in.
- **libraries** (*Optional*, list of libraries): A list of `platformio libraries <https://platformio.org/lib>`__
  to include in the project. See `platformio lib install <https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/userguide/lib/cmd_install.html>`__.
- **board_flash_mode** (*Optional*, string): The `SPI flash mode <https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/SPI-Flash-Modes>`__
  to use for the board. One of ``qio``, ``qout``, ``dio`` and ``dout``. Defaults to ``dout``.

Automations:

- **on_boot** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  when the node starts. See :ref:`pi4home-on_boot`.
- **on_shutdown** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  right before the node shuts down. See :ref:`pi4home-on_shutdown`.
- **on_loop** (*Optional*, :ref:`Automation <automation>`): An automation to perform
  on each ``loop()`` iteration. See :ref:`pi4home-on_loop`.

.. _pi4home-pi4home_core_version:

``pi4home_core_version``
------------------------

With the ``pi4home_core_version`` parameter you can tell PI4Home which version of the C++ framework
to use when compiling code. For example, you can configure using the most recent (potentially unstable)
version of PI4Home straight from github. Or you can configure the use of a local copy of pi4home-core
using this configuration option.

First, you can configure the use of either the latest pi4home-core stable release (``latest``),
the latest development code from GitHub (``dev``), or a specific version number (``1.8.0``).

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    pi4home:
      # ...
      # Use the latest PI4Home stable release
      pi4home_core_version: latest

      # Or use the latest code from github
      pi4home_core_version: dev

      # Use a specific version number
      pi4home_core_version: 1.8.0

Alternatively, if you want to develop for PI4Home, you can download the
`latest code from GitHub <https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home-core/archive/dev.zip>`__, extract the contents,
and point PI4Home to your local copy. Then you can modify the PI4Home to your needs or to fix bugs.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    pi4home:
      # ...
      # Use a local copy of PI4Home
      pi4home_core_version:
        local: path/to/pi4home-core

And last, you can make PI4Home use a specific branch/commit/tag from a remote git repository:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    pi4home:
      # ...
      # Use a specific commit/branch/tag from a remote repository
      pi4home_core_version:
        # Repository defaults to https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home-core.git
        repository: https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home-core.git
        branch: master

      pi4home_core_version:
        repository: https://github.com/somebody/pi4home-core.git
        commit: d27bac9263e8a0a5a00672245b38db3078f8992c

      pi4home_core_version:
        repository: https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home-core.git
        tag: v1.8.0

.. _pi4home-arduino_version:

``arduino_version``
-------------------

PI4Home uses the arduino framework internally to handle all low-level interactions like
initializing the WiFi driver and so on. Unfortunately, every arduino framework version often
has its own quirks and bugs, especially concerning WiFi performance. With the ``arduino_version``
option you can tell PI4Home which arduino framework to use for compiling.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    pi4home:
      # ...
      # Default: use the recommended version, usually this equals
      # the latest version.
      arduino_version: recommended

      # Use the latest stable version
      arduino_version: latest

      # Use the latest staged version from GitHub, try this if you have WiFi problems
      arduino_version: dev

      # Use a specific version
      arduino_version: 2.3.0

For the ESP8266, you currently can manually pin the arduino version to these values (see the full
list of arduino frameworks `here <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases>`__):

* `2.4.2 <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases/tag/2.4.2>`__ (the latest version)
* `2.4.1 <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases/tag/2.4.1>`__
* `2.4.0 <https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/releases/tag/2.4.0>`__

For the ESP32, there's currently only one arduino framework version:
`1.0.0 <https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/releases/tag/1.0.0>`__.

.. _pi4home-on_boot:

``on_boot``
-----------

This automation will be triggered when the ESP boots up. By default, it is executed after everything else
is already set up. You can however change this using the ``priority`` parameter.

.. code-block:: yaml

    pi4home:
      # ...
      on_boot:
        priority: -10
        # ...
        then:
          - switch.turn_off: switch_1

Configuration variables:

- **priority** (*Optional*, float): The priority to execute your custom initialization code. A higher value (for example
  positive values) mean a high priority and thus also your code being executed earlier. So for example negative priorities
  are executed very late. Defaults to ``-10``. Priorities (you can use any value between them too):

  - ``100``: This is where all hardware initialization of vital components is executed. For example setting switches
    to their initial state.
  - ``50.0``: This is where most sensors are set up.
  - ``10``: At this priority, WiFi is initialized.
  - ``7.5``: MQTT initialization takes place at this priority.
  - ``-5.0``: The individual frontend counterparts for the backend components are configured at this priority
  - ``-10.0``: At this priority, pretty much everything should already be initialized.

- See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _pi4home-on_shutdown:

``on_shutdown``
---------------

This automation will be triggered when the ESP is about to shut down. Shutting down is usually caused by
too many WiFi/MQTT connection attempts, Over-The-Air updates being applied or through the :doc:`deep_sleep`.

.. note::

    It's not guaranteed that all components are in a connected state when this automation is triggered. For
    example, the MQTT client may have already disconnected.

.. code-block:: yaml

    pi4home:
      # ...
      on_shutdown:
        then:
          - switch.turn_off: switch_1

Configuration variables: See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

.. _pi4home-on_loop:

``on_loop``
-----------

This automation will be triggered on every ``loop()`` iteration (usually around every 16 milliseconds).

.. code-block:: yaml

    pi4home:
      # ...
      on_loop:
        then:
          # do something

.. _pi4home-platformio_options:

``platformio_options``
----------------------

Platformio supports a number of options in its ``platformio.ini`` file. With the ``platformio_options``
parameter you can tell PI4Home what options to pass into the ``env`` section of the platformio file
(Note you can also do this by editing the ``platformio.ini`` file manually).

You can view a full list of platformio options here: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/section_env.html

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    pi4home:
      # ...
      platformio_options:
        upload_speed: 115200
        board_build.f_flash: 80000000L
