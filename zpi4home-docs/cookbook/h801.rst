H801 RGBW LED controller
========================

The H801 is pretty afordable and easy to hack and adapt to your needs. It can be found on `Aliexpress <https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/bbnUDBZW>`__
`Here <http://tinkerman.cat/closer-look-h801-led-wifi-controller/>`__ is an article about the
hardware for those who have an interest for more details about the board.
It can be used as a RGB, RGBW, RGB dual white or even control 5 individual monochromatic strips if you want or combinations of these.

For PI4Home, you can then use the :doc:`RGBW </components/light/rgbw>`
and the :doc:`ESP8266 Software PWM output </components/output/esp8266_pwm>` components using below configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pi4home:
      name: h801light
      platform: ESP8266
      board: esp01_1m

        gateway: x.x.x.x
        subnet: 255.255.255.0

        red: pwm_r
        green: pwm_g
        blue: pwm_b
        white: pwm_w


Make your node in the pi4home dashboard and compile/upload it.
(if it fails OTA it must be uploaded manually with your favorite ESP flasher,
e.g. :ref:`pi4home-flasher <pi4home-flasher>`)

This LED strip can be used with the sketch as-is

.. figure:: images/rgbw.jpg
    :align: center
    :width: 80.0%

For this type of led strip you have to swap the white and blue gpio numbers in the sketch

You will need to solder pins to the board inside the h801 (fortunately its pretty roomy and
not a lot of components or stuff in the way part from the 2 wires on the back)

3.3v, GND, TX and RX (RX to RX and TX to TX) needs to be connected to your serial adapter, the
two other pins must be shorted throughout the flashing process by a jumper or a breadboard cable.
(Remember to remove it after flashing)
