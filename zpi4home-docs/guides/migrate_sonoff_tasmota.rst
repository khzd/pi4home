Migrating from previous Sonoff Tasmota setups is very easy. You just need to have
PI4Home create a binary for you and then upload that in the Tasmota web interface.

Getting Binary
--------------

First follow the guides for the :ref:`different supported devices <devices>` and create a configuration
file. Then, generate and download the binary:

- **Using the Hass.io add-on/dashboard**: Just click the ``COMPILE`` button, wait for
  the compilation to end and press the ``DOWNLOAD BINARY`` button.

- **Using the command line**: run ``pi4home livingroom.yaml compile`` (replacing
  ``livingroom.yaml`` with your configuration file of course) and navigate to the
  ``<NODE_NAME>/.pioenvs/<NODE_NAME>/`` folder. There you will find a ``firmware.bin`` file,
  this is the binary you will upload.

Uploading Binary
----------------

To upload the binary, navigate to the tasmota web interface and enter the
"Firmware Upgrade" section.

In the "Upgrade by file upload" section, choose the binary you previously downloaded

If everything succeeds, you will see an "Upload Successful" message and PI4Home
will connect to the configured WiFi network ðŸŽ‰
