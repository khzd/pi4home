For a detailed guide, please see https://khzd/pi4home/eguides/contributing.html#contributing-to-pi4homelib

Things to note when contributing:
 - Please test your changes :)
 - If a new feature is added or an existing user-facing feature is changed, you should also 
   update the [docs](https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home-docs). See [contributing to pi4home-docs](https://khzd/pi4home/guides/contributing.html#contributing-to-pi4homedocs)
   for more information.
 - Please also create a YAML counterpart of new features in [pi4home](https://github.com/khzd/pi4home/pi4home).
 - Sometimes I will let pull requests linger because I'm not 100% sure about them. Please feel free to ping
   me after some time.
